# Solutions of questions received from different places
## What is the purpose of this repo?
I plan to add two questions and answers to this repo every day to reinforce my knowledge during the Python learning phase, so that my knowledge will stay fresh and my algorithm skills will improve.
Some answers and questions may seem very simple to you. In these question solutions, which I started from the basic level, I did some places with help from the internet, but all of them include my own research and efforts.
